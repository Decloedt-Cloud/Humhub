# JWT SSO

With the JWT SSO module, users can be automatically registered and logged into the HumHub installation using a JWT token.

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information (like user profile and login data) between parties (HumHub and another application) as a JSON object. 

This module is only the HumHub component of an SSO process. An additional application is required which provides the login data in the form of a JWT token.
